### [UX-UI Designer (role)](https://www.notion.so/UX-UI-Designer-role-9cc108667c79420882c57e92c9a6bc6d?pvs=21)

UX/UI designers are responsible for designing user interfaces that are visually appealing and easy to use. This includes designing layouts, color schemes, and typography, as well as creating icons and other visual elements. They take care of the details to ensure that the user interface is consistent with the overall brand and design of the product.

In addition to designing the visual aspects of the user interface, a UX/UI designer is also responsible for creating a positive user experience. In contrast to product designers, UX/UI designers rely mainly on design intuition and professional experience and to a lesser extent on direct user research.

**Defining characteristic of UX/UI Designer role:** High fidelity design mockups informed by design intuition and professional experience.
